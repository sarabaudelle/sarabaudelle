                <p class="pb-4">Back in 2019, I joined a college workshop held by a group of senior weaving artisans. These artisans were making an effort to move into the digital space to attract younger generations but with no success: difficulty setting up and managing online stores, lack of visibility and user-friendly Portuguese platforms, etc.</p>
                <p>During this event, I noticed how my peers were fascinated with how they reinvented their art to craft pieces any Gen-Z would use, and wanted to support their work. Atelier was born from these conversations - a national marketplace connecting crafters and younger generations. </p>

                <p>We had two rounds of user testing with a small focus group. Each group was given tasks in Typeform,
                    and they had to rate the level of difficulty of each task using an SEQ Likert scale. In the end,
                    users rated their experiences in a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. Heatmaps were
                    recorded using UserBerry.</p>
